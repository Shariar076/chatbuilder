# Update-1
We have completed our planning and initial wireframing of the system. We are currently defining the JSON schema for parsing the chatbot workflows using visual descriptors. We are working on the chatbot code generator and designing the UI using Flutter in parallel. 
We are also documenting possible functionalities by exploring state-of-the-art systems like VoiceFlow. Initial prototypes should be ready soon.
